# Neighborhood Map

## About
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## How did it help me
- Interacting with API servers
- Use of third-party libraries and APIs
- Asynchronous programming

## How to use
- get the app from https://midaa.github.io/Neighborhood-map-project/
- you can search places to filter out the rest 
- you can click on markers to get details on the selected place

#### Note
